Inspired by my experience developing visuals for PwC's startup investment publications, I embarked on a deeper exploration of the dataset to uncover compelling narratives. Using Python, I extracted and analyzed data from the linked PDF dataset, providing rough estimates of startup investment figures. Transparently, I acknowledged these estimates in a disclaimer within the dashboard, ensuring clarity and accuracy. To stay on brand I stuck to the PwC colours for this dashboard.

## Project Highlights:

### Title: "Where is the Capital Going?"

I began by dissecting investment trends to elucidate their impact:

* Nature of Investments: Distinguishing between new and follow-on capital, revealing a substantial focus on follow-on investments in the software sector.
* Geographical Insights: Visualizing startup locations through a pie chart overlay, highlighting trends in new versus follow-on capital investments across regions.
* Seasonal Patterns: Analyzing investment peaks for new versus follow-on capital, pinpointing strategic investment periods.
* Capital Distribution: Examining funding frequency to illustrate the distribution of investments, indicating a vibrant startup landscape with significant first-round investments.

### Key Findings:

This analysis provided a comprehensive view of New Zealand's startup ecosystem:

* Despite prevalent follow-on investments, the influx of new capital exceeded expectations, reflecting investor openness to supporting emerging startups.
* The data underscored robust support for mature startups alongside continuous investment in new ventures, fostering a dynamic entrepreneurial environment.

Through these insights, I effectively portrayed the evolving landscape of startup investments, showcasing both strategic continuity and opportunities for growth.
