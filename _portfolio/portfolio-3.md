Another visualization I created during my time as a student was a dashboard focused on evaluating whether the brain drain was a significant issue for New Zealand. We were provided with data on departures and arrivals in New Zealand from Stats NZ. During my initial exploration, I realized that the departure and arrival data alone wasn't particularly compelling without an overarching theme.

I decided to narrow the scope to examine departures to Australia and incorporated GDP data from the World Bank. This allowed me to investigate whether the brain drain was indeed a pressing issue. Initially, overlaying the data seemed to present a convincing narrative: fluctuations in Australian GDP appeared to correlate with departure trends to Australia. However, I wanted to delve deeper.

By analyzing the actual percentage increase, I discovered that although New Zealand's GDP trend seemed worse, the difference was less than 5%, which wasn't particularly significant. This dashboard was an experiment to see if I could impactful insights through a single visualization.

I aimed for a compact dashboard with minimal coloring and text to ensure that insights could be quickly gleaned without sacrificing functionality. The result was a clear, focused visualization that effectively communicated the key findings.
