I am a data professional with extensive experience in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization. My career is marked by a proven track record of delivering powerful insights and value to 
stakeholders through innovative data solutions. With a passion for leveraging technology to bridge the gap between business and technical realms, I aim to drive informed decision-making and strategic growth in every role I undertake.

I hold a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Laws conjoint degree from the University of Auckland, majoring in Information Systems, Operations, and Supply Chain Management. Additionally, I have earned certifications in Agile Fundamentals, Business Analysis, and ARIS Enterprise Architecture. These qualifications have equipped me with a robust foundation in both business and technology, enabling me to tackle complex challenges with a well-rounded perspective.

In my professional journey, I have worked as an Insight Analyst at Air New Zealand and Worldline (Paymark), where I utilized tools like Power BI, Snowflake, and DBT to manipulate and analyze data. My roles involved developing robust data models, setting up automated refreshes, and standardizing reporting practices. I also implemented Robotic Process Automation solutions and maintained AWS data lakes, significantly enhancing team efficiency and comprehensive reporting capabilities. My tenure at PwC further honed my skills in financial advisory services, where I prepared financial statements, implemented Financial Intelligent Automation projects, and contributed to digital transformation initiatives.

At the University of Auckland, I have taken on the role of a Lecturer and Professional Teaching Fellow, delivering weekly lectures on data visualization techniques using Tableau to over 120 students. This academic role has allowed me to wrangle data using R and Python to create assessments for students to showcase their storytelling abilities in Tableau, I manage a team of Teaching Assistants, providing them with mentoring and pastoral support to ensure smooth delivery of the course. My teaching journey also includes serving as a Teaching Assistant, while I was a student, for database systems and a TuƒÅkana tutor for business systems, where I organized help sessions and provided academic support to Maori and Pasifika students.
