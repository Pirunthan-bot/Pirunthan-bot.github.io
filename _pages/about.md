I'm a data professional with a keen interest in data visualization, proficient in both Tableau and Power BI. I have hands-on experience with Tableau from my role as a part-time lecturer at The University of Auckland, where I teach a data visualization course. In this course, I guide students on how to effectively use Tableau alongside data visualization best practices. To effectively teach the class I am constantly engaged in finding, cleaning, and visualizing diverse datasets.

In addition to my academic role, I work in the industry, primarily utilizing Power BI. This dual experience has given me a strong grasp of both tools, enabling me to use them interchangeably based on project needs.

This portfolio is designed to showcase the various visualizations Iâ€™ve created using both Tableau and Power BI, reflecting my expertise and passion for data visualization.
