I am a Melbourne-based data professional with extensive experience in data analysis, modelling, automation, and visualization. I am passionate about using technology, machine learning, and AI to bridge business and technical domains—enabling data-driven decision-making, operational excellence, and strategic growth. Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered innovative solutions that unlock value, improve processes, and empower stakeholders across multiple industries.

I hold a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Laws conjoint degree from the University of Auckland, majoring in Information Systems, Operations, and Supply Chain Management, complemented by certifications in Agile Fundamentals, Business Analysis, and ARIS Enterprise Architecture. This diverse background allows me to approach complex challenges holistically, combining business acumen with technical expertise.

Professionally, I have applied my skills across leading organizations: at PwC, I contributed to digital transformation and financial automation initiatives; at Worldline, I delivered RPA solutions and enhanced reporting through AWS data lakes; at Air New Zealand, I championed self-service analytics, data governance, and automation using Power BI, Snowflake, and dbt; and currently at Jetstar, I build robust data models, automate reporting workflows, and apply machine learning techniques to improve workforce planning and decision-making.

Alongside my industry work, I have contributed to academia as a Lecturer and Professional Teaching Fellow at the University of Auckland, teaching data visualization and storytelling with Tableau, R, and Python as well as database management leveraging SQL. I take pride in mentoring students and promoting data literacy, including through my work supporting Māori and Pasifika learners.
