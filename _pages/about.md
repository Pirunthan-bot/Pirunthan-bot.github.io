I am a dynamic data professional with extensive experience in data analysis, manipulation, and visualization. My career has been defined by a consistent ability to deliver powerful insights and value to stakeholders through innovative data-driven solutions. With a deep passion for leveraging technology to bridge the gap between business and technical realms, I strive to enable informed decision-making and foster strategic growth in every role I take on.

I hold a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Laws conjoint degree from the University of Auckland, majoring in Information Systems, Operations, and Supply Chain Management. Additionally, I have earned certifications in Agile Fundamentals, Business Analysis, and ARIS Enterprise Architecture, providing me with a solid foundation to tackle complex challenges from both business and technology perspectives.

Professionally, I began my career as a Financial Analyst at PwC, where I contributed to Financial Intelligent Automation projects and digital transformation initiatives, preparing financial statements and improving workplace efficiency through data visualization and automation. My next role as an Insights Analyst at Worldline (Paymark) further strengthened my data analytics capabilities. There, I implemented Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions and worked extensively on AWS data lakes to enhance reporting accuracy and efficiency.

Currently, I am a Senior Reporting & Insights Analyst at Air New Zealand, where I utilize tools such as Power BI, Snowflake, and DBT to develop robust data models, automate reporting processes, and drive data governance initiatives.

In academia, I serve as a Lecturer and Professional Teaching Fellow at the University of Auckland, delivering lectures on data visualization techniques using Tableau to over 120 students. My role involves guiding students in data storytelling through tools like R and Python while managing a team of Teaching Assistants to ensure smooth course delivery. My commitment to education extends back to my time as a Teaching Assistant and Tuākana tutor, where I supported Māori and Pasifika students in their academic journeys through targeted help sessions and mentoring.
