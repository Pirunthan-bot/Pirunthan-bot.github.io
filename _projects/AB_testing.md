How do mobile games retain players, and what keeps them engaged? Dive into an A/B testing analysis of **Cookie Cats**, a popular mobile game, where I evaluate two different game versions to optimize player retention. Using statistical analysis, I provide insights into which version leads to better player engagement and long-term retention. Discover how A/B testing techniques and data-driven decision-making can significantly impact game design and monetization strategies.

## Project Workflow:

In this project, I leveraged R to analyze Cookie Cats' player retention data. By splitting players into two groups — one that encountered a gate at level 30 and another at level 40 — I tested which placement best retains players. The dataset includes thousands of players, making this a robust experiment in mobile gaming.

## Data Processing:

I used `tidyverse` to clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring there were no inconsistencies or missing data points. The primary objective was to calculate the retention rates at various stages and visualize the differences between the two player groups. Using statistical tests like the **t-test**, I compared player behaviors to determine which gate position was more effective for retention.

## Insightful Reporting:

The analysis culminated in a comprehensive report, visualizing key metrics such as retention rates for day 1, day 7, and day 14. I also explored the statistical significance of the difference between groups using hypothesis testing, allowing us to make data-backed recommendations on gate placements.
